# Traffic_light_detetect_

Using OpenCV to detect traffic light 

To start, I'm a complete beginner with Computer Vision and I made this project following multiple tutorials. I wanted to create a simple program that would take any input image (in my case, my dashcam footage) and detect/recognize the traffic lights.

Instruction : 
1. Install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install pip (https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows)
3. Download the code of this repository as .zip file (top of the page, green button 'Code')
4. Extract the .zip file to any folder of your choosing
5. Open a terminal (CMD, Powershell, ect.)
6. Type the following command: pip install opencv-python numpy and press 'enter'
7. Go to the folder with all the files and copy the file path
8. Open your terminal again (CMD, Powershell, etc.) and enter the following: cd path\of\your\files and press 'enter'
9. To run the program, enter the following: python Traffic_light_detect_.py -i IMAGE  and press 'enter'. If you want to exit the program while it's running, press esc


I hope the instructions are clear and easy to follow. With every project, I will try to make the instructions as beginner-friendly as possible.
